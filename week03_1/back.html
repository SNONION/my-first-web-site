    <p><strong><u>The best back workout: build a stronger back and improve your posture</u></strong>Incorporating exercises from the best back workout has multiple benefits, as it will help balance out the muscles developed during the popular pushing moves (bench press, shoulder press etc), and improve posture to reduce the chance of injury, while building a rock-solid foundation upon which you can improve almost every other aspect of training.

        <p>1. Barbell bent-over row - 8-12 reps x 4 sets</p>

        <p>Grab a barbell, load it up with some light weights to start with and place it on the floor in front of you. Place your feet underneath the bar so laces can be seen on the other side and get hold of it with a solid, overhand grip, ensuring your hands are around shoulder-width apart, or slightly wider.</p>

        <p>From here, keep a flat back, brace your shoulders by pulling them back and squeezing them down towards your butt and bring the bar to waist height by driving through the heels. This will also help you practice your deadlift form.</p>
